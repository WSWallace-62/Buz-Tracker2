# Enhanced Project Deletion Confirmation

## Overview
This document describes the enhanced project deletion confirmation feature that provides additional safety measures when deleting projects.

## Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced Confirmation Dialog (`src/components/ConfirmDialog.tsx`)
- Added support for optional text input validation
- Users must type a specific confirmation text before the confirm button becomes enabled
- The dialog now includes:
  - An input field (when `requireText` is provided)
  - Visual feedback showing what text needs to be typed
  - Disabled confirm button until the exact text is entered
  - Auto-focus on the input field for better UX

### 2. Updated UI Store (`src/store/ui.ts`)
- Extended the `confirmDialog` interface to include an optional `requireText` field
- Updated the `showConfirm` function signature to accept the `requireText` parameter
- This allows any confirmation dialog in the app to optionally require text input

### 3. CustomerProjectManager Component (`src/components/CustomerProjectManager.tsx`)
- Added `customerName` prop to provide context in deletion dialogs
- Enhanced `handleDelete` function to:
  - Display the company name the project belongs to
  - Require typing `Delete-ProjectName` before deletion is enabled
  - Show a more detailed warning message including:
    - Project name
    - Company name
    - Warning about session deletion
    - "This action cannot be undone" message

### 4. CustomerCard Component (`src/components/CustomerCard.tsx`)
- Updated to pass `customerName` prop to `CustomerProjectManager`
- Ensures the company name is available for the deletion dialog

### 5. ProjectManagerModal Component (`src/components/ProjectManagerModal.tsx`)
- Enhanced `handleDelete` function to:
  - Look up the customer name if the project is linked to a customer
  - Display the company name in the deletion message (if available)
  - Require typing `Delete-ProjectName` before deletion is enabled
  - Maintain consistency with the CustomerProjectManager deletion flow

## User Experience

### Before Deletion
1. User clicks the delete button on a project
2. A confirmation dialog appears showing:
   - Project name
   - Company name (if linked to a customer)
   - Warning about session deletion
   - An input field with instructions

### Confirmation Process
1. User must type exactly `Delete-ProjectName` (e.g., `Delete-Website Redesign`)
2. The confirm button remains disabled until the text matches exactly
3. Once the correct text is entered, the confirm button becomes enabled
4. User can then click confirm to delete the project

### Safety Features
- **Two-step confirmation**: User must both type the confirmation text AND click the confirm button
- **Visual feedback**: The required text is highlighted in red
- **Clear messaging**: Multiple warnings about data loss
- **Company context**: Shows which company the project belongs to
- **Disabled state**: Confirm button is visually disabled until validation passes

## Benefits

1. **Prevents Accidental Deletions**: The requirement to type the project name significantly reduces the risk of accidentally deleting the wrong project
2. **Better Context**: Showing the company name helps users verify they're deleting the correct project
3. **Consistent UX**: The same deletion flow works in both the CustomerProjectManager and ProjectManagerModal
4. **Accessibility**: Proper focus management and keyboard navigation support
5. **Dark Mode Support**: All new UI elements support dark mode

## Technical Details

### Confirmation Text Format
- Format: `Delete-{ProjectName}`
- Example: If project name is "Website Redesign", user must type: `Delete-Website Redesign`
- Case-sensitive exact match required

### Dialog Message Format
```
Are you sure you want to delete "{ProjectName}" from {CompanyName}?

This will also delete all associated time sessions.

This action cannot be undone.
```

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for the future:
1. Add a count of sessions that will be deleted
2. Option to export project data before deletion
3. Soft delete with recovery period
4. Bulk deletion with enhanced confirmation
